## How to update layouts

1. Save your layout in the same filename as the one you wish to update, overwriting it.
1. Open your favourite git editor and find the lines that include the changes that you did.
1. Commit these lines only. VSCode with the GitLens plugin is a good choice for that.
1. Discard the rest of the changes. Thus you discard non-functional xml properties reordering and graphs that have been deleted because some timeseries could be absent from your last-opened log.
